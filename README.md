# Istante

> Immortalize moments, authenticate memories – on the blockchain forever

_Istante_, derived from the rich Italian language, carries the dual meaning of both "instant" and "moment"—an aptly chosen name for an innovative application designed to immortalize and authenticate significant moments through cutting-edge blockchain technology.

## Overview

Istante is a sophisticated Farcaster App that empowers users to create permanent, immutable records of their cherished moments on the robust Base blockchain network. To ensure authenticity and maintain the integrity of these documented experiences, each participant must provide their unique digital signature as verification of their presence and participation in the moment.

After capturing a special moment and generating a blockchain-based attestation (with a commemorative image), both specifically invited participants and public members (for public events) can create and collect NFTs associated with that moment. The original creator maintains complete control over the pricing structure of these unique digital artifacts.
